This is a screenshot of Microsoft Power BI's Model view interface, titled "Platform Projections Model V0.3 - Last saved: Yesterday at 11:40 AM." It depicts a relational data model schema with tables arranged in a semi-hierarchical layout, connected by relationship lines (indicating joins, likely one-to-many based on cardinalities). The background is light gray, with tables as white cards containing column lists. Some columns have icons like sigma (âˆ‘) for sums/aggregates, asterisks (*) for measures or keys, and arrows for collapses.
Key Tables and Structure (Expanded from Initial Description)
Using a table for clarity on comparisons and enumerations:
Category	Table Name	Key Columns/Measures	Notes/Connections
Dimensions	DateTable	MonthName, MonthNumber, Year, YearName	Connects to multiple fact tables on time fields like "Month". Temporal hierarchy for projections.
	AccountsTable	Accounts, ActiveAccounts, ActiveShare, CheckingAccounts, CheckingShare, CheckingUsage	Account metrics; links to calcs and balances on shared keys like "ActiveAccounts".
	Scenarios	DefaultMultiplier, ScenarioDisplay, ScenarioName	For what-if analysis; connects to views on "ScenarioName".
Facts/Calcs	CalcsTable	Accounts, ActiveShare, CheckingAccounts, CheckingShare, CheckingUsage, CheckingUsageRate, DefaultMultiplier, Month	Aggregations; central hub linking dimensions.
	InflowsTable	ACHInAmount, ACHInPerActive, ACHInQuantity, ACHInRate, ActiveAccounts, DefaultMultiplier, Month, RTPInAmount, RTPInPerActive	Incoming payments (ACH/RTP); tied to accounts and time.
	OutflowsTable	ACHOutAmount, ACHOutPerActive, ACHOutQuantity, ACHOutRate, ACHOutShare, ActiveAccounts, DebitCardTransactionAmount, DebitCardTransactionRate, DebitCardTransactionShare	Outgoing flows; similar links.
	BalancesTable	Accounts, ActiveShare, CheckingAccounts, CheckingBalance, CheckingShare, CheckingUsage, CheckingUsageRate, DefaultMultiplier	Balance snapshots.
	AverageBalances	AvgCheckingBalance, AvgSavingsBalance, CheckingBalance, Month, SavingsBalance, ScenarioDisplay, ScenarioName	Averaged over time/scenarios.
Views	PartnerFileView	AvgCheckingBalance, AvgSavingsBalance, CheckingBalance, CheckingInterestRevenue, DebitCardTransactionAmount, InterchangeRevenue, Month, PartnerInterchangeRate, PartnerInterestRate, SavingsBalance, SavingsInterestRevenue, ScenarioDisplay, ScenarioName, TotalInterestRevenue, TotalPartnerRevenue	Partner revenue focus; aggregates from balances/flows.
	PlatformView	Accounts, ActiveAccounts, ActiveShare, AvgCheckingBalance, AvgSavingsBalance, CheckingAccounts, CheckingBalance, CheckingShare, CheckingUsage, CheckingUsageRate, DebitCardTransactionAmount, DefaultMultiplier, InterchangeRevenue, InterchangePerFeePerActive, MembershipRevenue, MembershipFeePerActive, Month, Monthly_Checking, Net_Remaining_For_Savings, OtherFeeRevenue, OtherFeesPerActive, PlatformContribution, PlatformInterchangeRate, PlatformSGA	Platform-level metrics; includes costs like SGA.
Parameters/Inputs	InterpolatedInputs	InputType, Month, Value	Time-interpolated values.
	GlobalNumericParameters	InputType, Value	Numeric globals.
	GlobalTextParameters	InputType, TextValue	Text globals.
	Parameters	InputType, Month, Value	General params.
	CustomMultiplier	CustomMultiplierValue	Adjustments.
	MeasuresP	Category, Checking EOY Balance, Partner Interchange Rate, Partner Interest Rate, Savings EOY Balance, TotalAvgBalance	KPIs like end-of-year balances.
The model appears designed for financial projections in a BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service) context, supporting scenarios, revenue calculations (e.g., interest, fees), and balances over time. Relationships flow from dimensions to facts to views, forming a star-like schema. If you meant a different path or need edits, let me know!
